# Sentinel Hub's cloud detector for Sentinel-2 imagery

**NOTE: s2cloudless masks are now available as a precomputed layer within Sentinel Hub. Check the [announcement blog post](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/cloud-masks-at-your-service-6e5b2cb2ce8a) and [technical documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/#/API/data_access?id=cloud-masks-and-cloud-probabilities).**

The **s2cloudless** Python package provides automated cloud detection in
Sentinel-2 imagery. The classification is based on a *single-scene pixel-based cloud detector*
developed by Sentinel Hub's research team and is described in more detail
[in this blog](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/improving-cloud-detection-with-machine-learning-c09dc5d7cf13).

The **s2cloudless** algorithm was part of an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms. The s2cloudless algorithm was validated together with 9 other algorithms on 4 different test datasets and in all cases found to be on the Pareto front. See [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722001043?via%3Dihub)

## Installation

The package requires a Python version >= 3.8. The package is available on
the PyPI package manager and can be installed with

```
$ pip install s2cloudless
```

To install the package manually, clone the repository and
```
$ pip install .
```

One of `s2cloudless` dependencies is `lightgbm` package. If having problems during installation, please
check the [LightGBM installation guide](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html).

Before installing `s2cloudless` on **Windows**, it is recommended to install package `shapely` from
[Unofficial Windows wheels repository](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)

## Input: Sentinel-2 scenes

The inputs to the cloud detector are Sentinel-2 images. In particular, the cloud detector requires the following 10 Sentinel-2 band reflectances: B01, B02, B04, B05, B08, B8A, B09, B10, B11, B12, which are obtained from raw reflectance values in the following way: `B_i/10000`. From product baseline `04.00` onward additional harmonization factors have to be applied to data according to [instructions from ESA](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/en/web/sentinel/-/copernicus-sentinel-2-major-products-upgrade-upcoming).

You don't need to worry about any of this, if you are using Sentinel-2 data obtained from [Sentinel Hub Process API](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/api/process/). By default, the data is already harmonized according to [documentation](https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/sentinel-2-l1c/#harmonize-values). The API is supported in Python with [sentinelhub-py](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinelhub-py) package and used within `s2cloudless.CloudMaskRequest` class.

## Examples

A Jupyter notebook on how to use the cloud detector to produce cloud mask or cloud probability map
can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/sentinel-hub/sentinel2-cloud-detector/tree/master/examples).
